# Riyadh-Public-Transport
For this assignment, we used Riyadh Metro Stations dataset to envision and build a comprehensive RTA (Riyadh Transport Authority) dashboard. To guide our creativity, here are the cases we explored:
1- Urban Mobility Analysis: Evaluate the distribution and accessibility of metro stations across the city.
2- Transportation Planning: Assess station usage based on the number of ratings and user reviews.
3- Navigation & Mapping: Enhance public transport insights by visualizing real-time station locations.
4- Service Optimization: Identify underserved areas where metro service improvements are needed.
