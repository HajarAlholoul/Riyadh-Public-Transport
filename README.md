# Riyadh-Public-Transport
For this assignment, we used Riyadh Metro Stations dataset to envision and build a comprehensive RTA (Riyadh Transport Authority) dashboard.
To guide our creativity, here are some of the cases we explored:
Urban Mobility Analysis: Evaluate the distribution and accessibility of metro stations across the city.
Transportation Planning: Assess station usage based on the number of ratings and user reviews.
Navigation & Mapping: Enhance public transport insights by visualizing real-time station locations.
Service Optimization: Identify underserved areas where metro service improvements are needed.
